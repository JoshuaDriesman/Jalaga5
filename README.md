## Jalaga5

Jalaga5 is a simple star shooter written in JavaScript using the HTML5 canvas element. It was inspired by Galaga, 
and I wrote it in order to learn JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas element. To run it, simply open index.html in an HTML5 compatible browser. 
To play, use the arrow keys to move your ship, and the spacebar to shoot. Enjoy!

#### Known Bugs
- If you let the game run long enough, all of the enemy ships will shift to the left side.
